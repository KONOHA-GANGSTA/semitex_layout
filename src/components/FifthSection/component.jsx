            Like the phrase “stem cell” itself, “stem cell therapy” is often
            used to describe a variety of different medical therapies that
            utilize stem cells in some form to treat a patient. Sometimes the
            term is used incorrectly to refer to platelet rich plasma (PRP)
            injections. The term is also used to refer to stem cell transplants,
            also known as bone marrow transplants.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most commonly “stem cell therapy” is used to describe a procedure
            where the patient’s adult stem cells and other potentially
            regenerative cells are harvested from a tissue sample of either fat
            or bone marrow taken from the patient. These concentrated
            regenerative cells are then used to treat specific injuries
            typically by injecting them into the afflicted area. It should be
            said that this type of stem cell therapy is currently not FDA
            approved and clinics performing it illegally in the US or in other
            countries perform various versions of the procedure to treat
            illnesses and injuries with little to no clinical evidence.

            At InGeneron we use the term “regenerative cell therapy” since there
            are many different cell types and regenerative properties collected
            and used by our therapy along with adult stem cells. Importantly we
            do not treat patients outside of our approved clinical trials and we
            are dedicated to securing FDA approval through rigorous clinical
            testing.
